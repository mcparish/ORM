# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description

In this project, I was able to build the back end for an e-commerce website by modifying starter code.  In order to make this application functional, I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a PostgreSQL database.  

## Installation

After the database is created, the application must be seeded by entering npm run seed into the integrated terminal.  Once the data is seeded the application can be started by running the following command. npm run start.  

## Usage

Once the application is initialized the backend can now be used in insomnia.  From the point you can now test these various routes.  

    -GET Tags
    -GET Tag by ID
    -CREATE New Tag
    -UPDATE Tag
    -DELETE Tag by ID
    -GET Categories
    -GET Categories by ID
    -CREATE Category
    -UPDATE Category
    -DELETE Category by ID
    -GET All Products
    -GET One Product
    -CREATE Product
    -UPDATE Product
    -DELETE Product
